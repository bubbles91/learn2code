			<p>Doucmenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Walla Walla, WA</li> 
					<li>Magic City, ID</li> 
					<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
					<li>Last Chance, CO</li> 
					<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li> 
					<li>Why, AZ</li>
				</ol>

			<p>
			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
			</p> 
			<blockquote>
				Passing cars,<br>
				When you can't see,<br> 
				May get you,<br>
				A glipmse,<br> 
				Of eternity.<br>
			</blockquote> 
			<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

			<p>If you don't know what a Berma Shave style sign is, here is a little info to help.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Berma Shave Signs</dt>
					<dd>Road signs common in the U.S. in the 1920's and 1930's advertising shaving products. Signs were grouped in bunches of four, five or six, each with one line from the slogan.</dd>

			My first day of the trip! I can't believe that I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>cell phone</li>
					<li>iPod</li>
					<li>digital camera</li>
					<li>protein bar</li> 
				</ul>

    		<p>
			Just the essentials.<br> 
			As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
